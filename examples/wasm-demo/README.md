# The Minimal Demo for Plotters + WASM

You can run the demo locally using `npm`:
```bash
cd www
npm install
npm start
```

or with the following command under this directory (Python required).

```
./start-server.sh
```

For Windows users without Bash, `start-server.bat` can be used to launch the server.

```
start-server.bat
```
